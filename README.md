# Hyprland Workspace Toggle

A lightweight script to toggle between two workspace with Alt-Tab.  
Inspired by DWM.

For some reason HyprLand doesn't have default workspace toggling. I can use `rofi` or `wofi` with a keybind, but it was super inconvenient for me to switch between 2 
workspaces really fast like how I am used to in DWM. So I wrote this little script to accommodate my need.

## ‚ú® Features

- Quickly switch back & forth between two workspace
- Minimal and efficient
- No need to launch rofi/wofi just to jump between 2 places

## üìÅ Structure
/.config/hyprland/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hyprtoggle.sh

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ prevwin

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md


## üì¶ Installation

1. Save `hyprtoggle.sh` & 'prevwin' to somewhere like:
~/.config/hypr/hyprtoggle.sh (preferably)

2. Make it executable
chmod +x ~/.config/hypr/hyprtoggle.sh

3. Add this to your ~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf:
bind = Alt, Tab, exec, ~/.config/hypr/hyprtoggle.sh

Now you can switch between 2 workspace really really fast. xD

# Requirements
